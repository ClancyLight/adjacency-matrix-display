# sdl2-sims
Simulations and other various graphical demos.

## Setup

* Ubuntu:
    * Make sure SDL2 is installed
    * `apt-get install libsdl2-dev`
    * build by going to the `sdl2-proj/.` directory then run `make`

* Fedora:
    * `dnf install SDL2`
    * `dnf install SDL2-devel`
    * `make`

>note: Try to avoid building without `make build`. But if needed, then make sure the output executable has the `.o` extension. (`.gitignore` is ignoring `.o`
